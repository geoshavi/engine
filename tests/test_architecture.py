"""Architecture protection: the Gateway must stay the only path to a live
provider. Three separate rules, each failing with the offending file and
which rule it broke, so a regression is diagnosable from the assertion
alone:

  Rule A: only runtime/ and providers/ may import a provider SDK directly.
  Rule B: only runtime/gateway.py may import anything under providers/, with
          NO exceptions -- nothing outside providers/ itself names that
          package at all.

          This rule previously carried two standing allowlist exceptions,
          both of which were symptoms of things living in the wrong place
          rather than genuine needs. Recording them because the reasoning
          that removed them is the reason the rule can now be absolute:

            (1) `any name from providers.base` was allowed because Message
                and GenerationResult are the argument/return types of
                gateway.generate(), so every caller needed them -- the
                Gateway's own public API forced callers across the very
                boundary this rule exists to protect. Fixed by moving those
                two types to engine/llm_types.py, a neutral leaf owned by
                neither side (Rule F keeps it a leaf). The Provider protocol
                stayed in providers/base.py; nothing outside providers/ and
                the Gateway needs it.
            (2) `providers.registry.DEFAULT_MODELS` was allowed because it
                is a plain dict of model-name strings that cannot call out.
                True, but it is configuration, not provider machinery, and
                its placement made api.py, cli.py, and orchestrator/engine.py
                import the provider package purely to read config. Fixed by
                moving it to engine/config.py.

          An allowlist was the right shape while exceptions existed: a
          blocklist (naming AnthropicProvider, build_provider, etc.) was
          tried first and missed `import engine.providers` reaching the same
          classes via attribute access. With zero exceptions the distinction
          is moot -- every import form is judged by module path alone, which
          subsumes both failure modes.
          Residual gap, acknowledged rather than silently ignored: a fully
          dynamic `importlib.import_module("engine.providers...")` has no
          import statement for AST to see at all. No static import scanner
          can close that; it would need a runtime import hook instead.
  Rule C: providers/ must not import runtime/ -- the dependency runs one
          way only (gateway -> provider). A cycle here would defeat the
          reason runtime/ lives outside orchestrator/ in the first place
          (so verification/ can import it without reaching into
          orchestrator/).
  Rule D: eval/ may only depend on verification/, runtime/, and state/
          (plus engine.config, needed everywhere, and stdlib/third-party).
          Everything else -- orchestrator/ (including agents/), providers/,
          api.py, cli.py, reporting/ -- is forbidden. This is
          stricter than "don't import providers/ or an SDK" (which Rule
          A/B already give eval/ for free by placement under src/engine/):
          it caught a real violation during development, where eval/runner.py
          imported write_files from orchestrator/agents/common.py. Fixed by
          giving eval/ its own minimal file-writer instead -- dataset file
          paths are hand-authored, not LLM output, so they don't need
          write_files()'s path-traversal guard in the first place.
  Rule E: verification/, runtime/, and state/ must never import eval/ --
          the dependency runs one way only (eval -> verification/runtime/
          state). Eval is a *client* of the review flow, not a dependency
          of it; those three packages must stay usable without eval/ ever
          being on the import path.
  Rule F: engine/llm_types.py must import nothing from engine.* -- it holds
          the gateway <-> provider data contract precisely because both
          sides may import it, which also makes it the one module in the
          tree that every layer can reach. A single engine.* import there
          would turn it into a back-channel joining layers that Rules B-E
          otherwise keep apart (e.g. an import of engine.state would hand
          providers/ a path to the database). Keeping it a stdlib-only leaf
          is what makes it safe for everyone to depend on.
