"""The gateway <-> provider data contract, owned by neither side.

``Message`` and ``GenerationResult`` are the input and output types of
``LLMGateway.generate()``, so every caller of the Gateway needs them. They
used to live in ``providers/base.py``, which forced a choice between two bad
options: either every caller imports the provider package just to build the
Gateway's arguments (defeating the point of Rule B -- the Gateway is supposed
to be the only thing reaching into providers/), or Rule B carries a permanent
allowlist exception for ``providers.base``. The repo took the second option
and documented it; this module removes the need for either.

They cannot live in ``runtime/`` instead, because Rule C forbids providers/
from importing runtime/ and the provider implementations need these types to
satisfy the ``Provider`` protocol. A neutral leaf that both sides may import
is the only placement that keeps every rule exception-free.

Deliberately a leaf: this module imports nothing from ``engine.*`` and must
stay that way, so it can never become a back-channel between layers that the
architecture rules otherwise keep apart. Enforced by Rule F in
tests/test_architecture.py.

The ``Provider`` protocol itself stays in ``providers/base.py`` -- it
describes how a provider is implemented, which is genuinely provider-layer
concern, and nothing outside providers/ and the Gateway needs it.
